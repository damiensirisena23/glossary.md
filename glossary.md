## Front end Developer
A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer. Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.

## IDE
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is an application used to write, run, and test code. IDEs are used by programmers to develop software in an easy manner without having to risk ruining live versions of the code. Basic functions of an IDE usually include a source code editor, a build automation tool, and a debugger.

## VSCode
Visual Studio Code, commonly known as VScode, is a source code editor created by everyone's favorite company Microsoft. Features include debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, snippets, code refactoring and Git. VScode is a useful tool to wrtie a multitude of coding languages in a singular loaction/application.

## Golang
Golang, also known as Go, is a programming language developed by Google. It was created by a team of engineers at Google, including Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, with the goal of combining the simplicity and efficiency of programming languages like C and C++ with modern features that address some of the shortcomings of those languages.

Key features of the Go programming language include:

Simplicity and Clarity: Go was designed with a focus on simplicity and readability. Its syntax is clean and straightforward, making it easy for developers to write and understand code.

Concurrency Support: Go includes built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels. Goroutines are lightweight threads that enable concurrent execution, while channels facilitate communication and synchronization between goroutines.

Fast Compilation: Go's compiler is known for its speed, which makes the development process more efficient. Quick compilation times are especially useful for larger projects.

Garbage Collection: Go features automatic memory management with a garbage collection system that helps developers manage memory without manual memory allocation and deallocation.

Static Typing: Go is statically typed, which means that variable types are determined at compile time. This helps catch type-related errors early in the development process.

Standard Library: Go comes with a rich standard library that provides many essential functions and packages for tasks like networking, file I/O, and more.

Cross-Platform Support: Go is designed to be portable and is available on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions.

Open Source: Go is open source, which means that its source code is available to the public, allowing developers to contribute to its development and create their own modifications.

Go has gained popularity for its performance, simplicity, and suitability for building scalable and efficient software systems. It's often used for web development, system programming, network services, and cloud-based applications. Its concurrency features make it particularly well-suited for applications that require handling multiple tasks simultaneously.

Overall, Go has become a valuable tool in the programming world, offering developers a modern and efficient language for a wide range of applications.

## PaaS
(Platform as a Service) 
PaaS (Platform as a Service), as the name suggests, provides you computing platforms which typically includes operating system, programming language execution environment, database, web server etc. Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos.

## SaaS
Saas stands for Software as a Service and is a way for applications to be accessed over the internet
(Software as a Service) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis.
