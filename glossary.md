## Front end Developer
A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer. Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system that is used in software development to manage and track changes in source code. Git is one of the most popular version control systems due to its speed, flexibility, and ability to handle projects of various sizes. Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously and independently by maintaining a full copy (clone) on each developer's machine. It offers numerous advantages, including offline work, faster performance, and the ability to revert to previous versions easily.Git is also known for its branching and merging capabilities, enabling developers to work on different features or bug fixes concurrently and later integrate those changes back into the main codebase.

Repository: A repository, often referred to as "repo," is a directory that contains your project's files and the entire version history.
Commit: A commit represents a snapshot of changes to the repository at a specific point in time. It includes a message describing the changes made.
Branch: A branch is a separate line of development that diverges from the main codebase. It allows for isolated work on new features or bug fixes.
Merge: Merging combines changes from one branch into another, allowing developers to integrate their work back into the main branch.
Pull Request: In Git-based platforms like GitHub, a pull request is a mechanism for proposing changes to a repository. It allows for code review and discussion before merging.
Clone: Cloning a repository creates a copy on a developer's local machine, allowing them to work on the project independently.
Push and Pull: Pushing involves sending your committed changes to a remote repository, while pulling fetches the latest changes from a remote repository to your local one.
Conflict Resolution: When two or more people modify the same file concurrently, conflicts can arise. Git provides tools to help resolve these conflicts.

Example Git commands:
# Clone a remote repository to your local machine
git clone <repository-url>

## IDE
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is an application used to write, run, and test code. IDEs are used by programmers to develop software in an easy manner without having to risk ruining live versions of the code. Basic functions of an IDE usually include a source code editor, a build automation tool, and a debugger.
